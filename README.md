## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of **Blinkit (formerly Grofers)** — one of India's leading instant delivery grocery services.

The goal is to analyze historical sales data to uncover patterns in:
- Customer behavior
- Sales performance over time
- Product trends
- Operational insights

By leveraging data-driven storytelling, this project aims to answer key business questions and lay the foundation for future **predictive modeling**, **customer segmentation**, and **business optimization**.

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Instant delivery services operate in a **high-pressure, low-margin** environment. Gaining insights into when, what, and how customers purchase can:
- Improve inventory forecasting
- Identify high-performing SKUs
- Pinpoint peak sales hours/days
- Support marketing strategies with data-backed customer segmentation

This EDA serves as a **decision-support tool** to guide those insights.

## 📊 Key Insights

🔍 Here's a sneak peek at some of the business-relevant discoveries:

| Insight | What it Means |
|--------|----------------|
| 📈 **Peak Ordering Time** | Highest orders placed between **7-9 PM**, aligning with post-work grocery runs |
| 🛒 **Top-Selling Categories** | "Dairy", "Beverages", and "Personal Care" consistently lead in sales volume |
| 📅 **Day-wise Trends** | Sales spike over weekends, especially **Saturday evenings** |
| 🔁 **Repeat Item Patterns** | Certain products (e.g., milk, bread) are frequently reordered — ideal for subscriptions |
| 💸 **SKU Distribution** | A small percentage of products drive majority of revenue — classic **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)** |
